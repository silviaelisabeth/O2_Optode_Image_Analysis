# O2 Optode Image Analysis in Python

This repository provides a comprehensive pipeline for the image analysis of optical chemical sensors, with a focus on oxygen (Oâ‚‚) sensors. 
It includes functionalities for reading images from files, splitting them into individual color channels, selecting region of interests and developing a calibration model to accurately interpret sensor responses. The calibrated model is then applied to measurement images to extract quantitative data. Processed images can be saved in a format compatible with ImageJ for further analysis. Ideal for researchers working with luminescent or colorimetric optical sensors.
